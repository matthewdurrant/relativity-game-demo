The program architecture is basically the architecture of the ship computer. 
The main ship has modules that interact with the hardware of the ship etc.

You are not really present in the game, you are present in real life, the program simulating your ship which you interact with through the console.

Some items have a ... a ... coordinate time sell-by date. E.g. fashion and electronics.
Like a 2028 suit, or a 2025 TV.
Locations have a "culture time". Earth sets the culture, planets are behind depending on distance.

Other goods have a general sell-by date. Fresh food only lasts a month, refridgerated food longer, etc.
The shorter the sell-by the more valuable the good.
E.g. fresh sushi from Earth is worth a mint on Alpha Centauri but goes stinky quickly.

The player has to choose their speed.
Too fast and the world goes by without them.
Too slow and they don't make enough money.

The player can get stuck hundreds of light years away. They don't have enough fuel for a quick jump home. 
They can get home ... but they will be dead of old age.
